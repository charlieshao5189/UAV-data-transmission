## Abstract:
This paper presents a literature review on strategies for
data transmission from small-sized Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV). It is part of a preliminary investigation for
further research on data transmission from UAV, which will
help us to identify history and present state of this area. Some
basic concepts of UAV are introduced in this literature
review, and different applications are identified through
surveys on this area. Through analysis of these applications,
corresponding data are classified into three distinct types:
radio control (RC) data, telemetry data and application
sensor data. They are transmitted through different data links.
The specifications of different data transmission strategies
are compared on this paper. The most popular wireless
network: Wi-Fi, 4G LTE and Bluetooth are also addressed on
this paper, their features are measured on UAV data
transmission scenes. The multi-UAV communication
strategies are also discussed and the Flying Ad-Hoc Network
(FANET) is introduced. At last a hypothesis about unified
data transmission link is raised.
